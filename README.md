# FACE-RECOGNITION-BASED-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
This is a problem of recognizing face with Mask for taking attendance by using face recognition technology . In this pandemic spread of covid-19, previously known biometric attendance system is a total mess as it may become a root of the virus, Hence there is a need to implement a system in which we can take attendance without actually touching the machine.This software is developed for daily student attendance in schools ,colleges and institutes during the pandemic situation (i.e.COVID-19).

The proposed system will reduce the paper work where attendance will no longer involve any manual recording. The new system will also reduce the total time needed to do attendance recording. The new system will acquire individual attendance by means of facial-recognition to secure data accuracy of the attendance. The followings are the objectives of this project:
